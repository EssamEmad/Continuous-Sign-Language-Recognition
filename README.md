# Continuous-Sign-Language-Recognition
We are building and training a model that translates variable-length videos of Chinese Sign Language into variable-length Mandarin sentences.

The continuous sign language dataset we are training on has been collected by Haung et al and was moved to a google cloud bucket for quicker and easier downloads.

## Contribution Guide

The notebook is documented and has information on how to run it (dataset vs cached dataset). If you'd like to contribute, please submit a pull-request.
